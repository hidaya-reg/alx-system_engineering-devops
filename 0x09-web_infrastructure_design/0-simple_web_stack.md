### Infrastructure Design:

#### 1. User Access:
- A user wants to access www.foobar.com via their web browser.

#### 2. Domain Name:
- Domain Name: foobar.com
- DNS record: www is a CNAME record pointing to the server's IP address 8.8.8.8

#### 3. Server Components:
- **Server**: Single server with:
  - **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
  - **Application Server**: Executes application-specific code and processes dynamic requests.
  - **Application Files**: Codebase residing on the server.
  - **Database (MySQL)**: Stores website data, interacts with the application server for data retrieval and storage.

#### Role Explanation:
- **Server**: A physical or virtual machine that hosts and serves the website components.
- **Domain Name**: A human-readable address used to access the website; www.foobar.com directs the user to the server's IP.
- **www DNS Record**: A CNAME record that specifies www as an alias for the domain foobar.com.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Acts as a reverse proxy, handling incoming HTTP requests and serving static content efficiently.
- **Application Server**: Executes application-specific code, processes dynamic requests, and interacts with the database.
- **Database**: Stores website data and is accessed by the application server to fetch or store information.

#### Communication:
- The server communicates with the user's computer by sending HTTP responses to the user's browser after processing the incoming HTTP request.

### Issues with this Infrastructure:

#### 1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
- As all components are hosted on a single server, if the server fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

#### 2. Downtime during Maintenance:
- Deploying new code or performing maintenance requires restarting the web server, causing downtime for users accessing the website.

#### 3. Scalability Limitation:
- Inability to handle high traffic; a single server setup may struggle to manage increased incoming traffic, leading to performance issues or site unavailability.

This setup provides a basic understanding of a one-server web infrastructure but has limitations in terms of reliability, scalability, and maintenance-induced downtime. To improve, considerations like load balancing, redundancy, and scaling across multiple servers would be necessary.
