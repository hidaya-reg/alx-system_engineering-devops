### Infrastructure Design:

#### 1. Additional Elements:
- **Two Servers**: Enhances load distribution and redundancy.
- **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: Efficiently distributes incoming traffic among servers for high availability.
- **Primary-Replica Database Cluster**: Improves database performance, availability, and fault tolerance.
- **Firewall and HTTPS**: Essential for security by restricting unauthorized access and encrypting data transmission.

#### 2. Load Balancer Configuration:
- **Load Balancer Algorithm**: Configured with Round Robin distribution, evenly distributing requests among servers in sequence.

#### 3. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
- **Active-Active Setup**: All servers handle requests simultaneously, sharing the load.
- **Active-Passive Setup**: One server is active while others remain standby, activating only if the primary fails.

#### 4. Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
- **Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster**: Primary manages write operations while replicas replicate data and handle read operations.

#### 5. Primary Node vs. Replica Node:
- **Primary Node**: Handles writes and serves as the authoritative source for data changes.
- **Replica Node**: Replicates data from the primary and primarily handles read operations, reducing the load on the primary.

### Issues with this Infrastructure:

#### 1. Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
- Lack of redundancy in critical components may lead to single points of failure if a server fails.

#### 2. Security Issues:
- Absence of firewall protection exposes the infrastructure to potential unauthorized access.
- Lack of HTTPS encryption compromises data security.

#### 3. Monitoring:
- Absence of monitoring tools makes it challenging to identify performance issues, security threats, or system failures proactively.

This infrastructure design improves scalability and redundancy but needs enhancements in addressing potential single points of failure, security vulnerabilities, and moni
